"""PHP 8.1 first-class callables emit ``indirect_call``, not ``calls`` (#15).

``$obj->method(...)`` creates a ``Closure`` — the method is *named*, not invoked,
so control flow does not transfer at that line.  The repo already models
"named but not invoked" as the distinct ``indirect_call`` relation, and PHP only
leaked into ``calls`` because the 8.1 grammar reuses ``member_call_expression``
for first-class-callable syntax.

Discriminator (probe-verified on the pinned tree-sitter-php 0.24.1): the
``arguments`` node of ``m(...)`` has exactly one named child, of type
``variadic_placeholder``.  ``m()``, ``m(1)`` and ``m(...$args)`` do not.

Target resolution and the refuse-don't-guess rules are UNCHANGED — only the
relation moves.  Every positive test carries a decoy class with an identically
named method that must get no edge.
