"""PHP receiver-typed member-call resolution (#1682, tracer bullet).

PHP ``member_call_expression`` nodes carry the receiver and the callee name, but
the extractor used to read only the bare name.  A ``$this->prop->method()`` call
must select the method owned by the property's DECLARED type; receivers whose
type is untyped, union-typed or ambiguous stay unlinked rather than minting a
false call edge.

Every test goes through the public ``extract()`` seam, and every positive case
carries a decoy class with an identically named method that must get no edge.

# ── Interface-typed receivers bind to the interface itself (#5, #53) ─────────
#
# Pre-#47 a PHP `interface_declaration` minted NO definition node, so an
# interface-typed receiver could only ever bind a same-short-named STRANGER.
# The dangerous case is Laravel's Contracts convention: `App\Contracts\Notifier`
# (interface) next to an unrelated `App\Support\Notifier` (class) — the
# short-name lookup found exactly one definition, the wrong one, and satisfied
# the ambiguity guard. #5 answered that with a blanket refusal keyed off a
# pre-scan of every interface/enum/trait name in the corpus.
#
# Post-#47 the declaration mints a canonical sourced node and its own methods
# attach to it, so the blanket refusal is no longer what keeps the stranger out:
# the collision now presents TWO definitions under the short name and is refused
# by the single-definition guard, or decisively by `PhpNameResolver` when the
# calling file `use`-imports the name. #53 lifts it, so a receiver typed with an
# UNAMBIGUOUS interface name binds to that interface's own method. Both halves
# are pinned below: the collisions stay unbound, the unique names now bind.
# Implementations are still never guessed.

# One `Notifier` in the corpus (an interface), plus a decoy class carrying the
# same METHOD name under a different type name — a bare method-name match would
# take the decoy, only the receiver's declared type picks the interface.

# other files, the extractor's LEGACY in-file bare-name arm never runs, so only
# the cross-file resolver is exercised.  When the candidate classes live in the
# SAME file as the call, that arm fires and binds the receiver to whichever
# same-named method the label index saw last — pure file order, stamped
# EXTRACTED.  A union or intersection annotation proves the receiver has MORE
# THAN ONE possible class, so the extractor must defer to the resolver (which
# refuses an unstamped receiver) instead.
#
# Deletion scope is deliberately limited to `A|B` / `A&B`.  The concrete-type
# policy also refuses `self`/`static`/`parent`, primitives and
# `mixed`/`object`/`iterable`/`callable`, but none of those declares MULTIPLE
# candidate classes — `self` in particular makes the in-file match likely
# correct — so they keep today's edge, exactly like a genuinely untyped receiver.
