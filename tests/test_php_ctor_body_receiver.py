"""Receiver typing from a constructor-BODY assignment of a typed param (#38).

The pre-promotion Laravel idiom declares the property untyped (its type living
only in a `@var` docblock) and assigns it in the constructor body from a typed
constructor parameter::

    /** @var ChargeCustomerService */
    protected $chargeCustomerService;
    public function __construct(ChargeCustomerService $chargeCustomerService) {
        $this->chargeCustomerService = $chargeCustomerService;
    }

The measured case is `app/Services/Billing/BalanceCustomerAccountService.php:14-20`
of api.lawnstarter.com @ `d2d4bed7ae`, whose `handle()` minted no `calls` edge to
`ChargeCustomerService::handle()`. The parameter's signature is the evidence —
the docblock is NOT read, and a property whose only type is a docblock stays
unbound (locked by `test_docblock_alone_still_emits_no_edge`).

The refusal discipline mirrors the local-variable one (#4): a property whose
constructor-body binding is not provably single-typed is POISONED — left out of
the receiver table entirely — rather than bound to a guess.

Every test goes through the public `extract()` seam, and every positive case
carries a decoy class with an identically named method that must get no edge.
