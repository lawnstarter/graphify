"""PHP qualified receiver types (#20).

The extractor used to flatten every written PHP type annotation to its short
name, so `private \\Vendor\\Sdk\\Client $c;` was indistinguishable from
`private Client $c;` — the compounding half of the #16 false-edge bug. This
ticket threads the WRITTEN qualified form alongside the short name for the four
annotation positions that type a receiver (properties, constructor-promoted
params, ordinary params and `new`-bound locals) and stamps it on the raw-call
fact as `receiver_type_qualified`.

Nothing consults the new field yet — the decisive refusal is #21 — so the
resolution tests here are PARITY tests: the short name still drives every edge,
bit for bit. The fact-shape tests use the per-file `extract_php` seam (the same
one `tests/test_ruby_resolution.py` uses for receiver-type facts), because the
raw-call facts are the extractor's output and never reach `{nodes, edges}`.
